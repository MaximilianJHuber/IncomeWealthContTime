# IncomeWealthContTime
Work in progress, hopefully!

This is a replication of the Aiyagari model of [Income and Wealth Distribution in Macroeconomics: A Continuous-Time Approach](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/HACT.pdf) by Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions and Moll. This implementation follows section 4 of the paper, and section 5 and 6 from the [numerical appendix](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/HACTproject/HACT_Numerical_Appendix.pdf).

Benjamin Moll's [website](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/HACTproject.htm) contains the code used for their paper.
